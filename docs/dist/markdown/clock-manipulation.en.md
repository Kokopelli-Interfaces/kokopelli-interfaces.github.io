# Clock Manipulation

ZZC promotes idea of phase-driven transport in VCV and many of ZZC modules can handle phase information represented by sawtooth wave.

You can generate clock + phase by [Clock](/clock-manipulation/clock) module, then stretch phase with [Divider](/clock-manipulation/divider) and use it in [FN-3](/generators/fn-3) to generate tempo-synced envelopes.
