> At Kokopelli Interfaces, we design interfaces to help one express their body's energies with sound. We help bring the village inside, outside. Whether it be a humming melancholy above the stomach, a chariot of energetic taps conjured by the mind, or a pad glowing to mirror the flames in a heart - we are here to help manifest. These visitors have travelled millenia through ancestral lines, taking form through past and present concert with the universe - they sing with the creative force of life! - and our mission is to make the bringing of them into the external world easier.

> In all of our design work, we follow the timeless principle - *'as within, so without'*. We do this because we believe in interfaces that take care to co-exist with one's experience of music. Our dream is for music creation devices that are expressive *and* welcome one to stay home while using them. Our dream is for  music creation devices that simply say: *'emerge together!'*
