> Fluid Live Song-Creation

> At the core of the (Emergem)[emergem] is 'Hearth'.



> Live-loopers are easily used but they can't express more than a loop of sounds.
>
> Digital-Audio-Workstations can create perfected timelines of sounds, but the computer energy they require interrupts music flow.
>
> With Hearth, you get the best of both worlds.


## Quick Start

### Create a loop

Connect your audio signal into the [band input](#inputs-band), and the [Song output](#outputs-song) into your speaker input.

Engage the [Change](#controls-change) knob to begin a transformation - this will start sending love to the new signals created by the band. You are now a band member playing in the song - so feel free to sing, strum a lute, or bang some rocks together.

When you are done, return the [Change](#controls-change) parameter to the default position so to send all the love to the song. You are no longer a band member.

The band member you just were was added to the song, and you will hear the audio looping.

> GRAY NERD HELPER: You can long-press the [progress forward](#controls-progress) button to undo the last addition.

Notice that when the Change returned, the [new member] display was incremented from 1 to 2. This display shows the next NEW members that will be loved, so the next band member armed for loving is the second.

You can repeat these steps to add more members to the song.

> The periods of new members do not have to be the same as the first member - you could record a new member with 4 times the period as the first one, and the [total period] will adjust.

> Hearth will automatically resize new member periods so that all periods are synced - so if your new capture was actually 3.6 or 4.2 times the first member's period, it will round it to 4.

### Transform a loop

So you have a song now! You are a conductor for this song. What you observe as Conductor is displayed in the [left window](#indicators-conductor), and is changed by setting the [Change](#controls-change) to the rest position, and by pressing the [change-observation button](#controls-change-observation).

> You can long-press the [change-observation button](#controls-change-observation) to _ascend_ and observe more of the song. This reflects becoming a more divine form (a King, a God, a Goddess). By ascending, you see more of the song of your body and your conductor flows in observation of your whole.

Remember that when the [Change](#controls-change) parameter is engaged, the song begins a transformation of the song.

What you observe as conductor. This is

You will notice if you twist this all the way, you will move all the energy away from the observed song and you will only hear the new signals of the band.

> 'What your love shows, grows.'

>

The Conductor can also transform particular voices by dynamically transform them using arbitrary functions like volume, equalization, distortion, delay.

> The conductor does this by moving energy from A to B.

 and record arbitrary transformations such as 'equalize', 'compress', 'distort', 'delay'.

#### Add fx

> Use the alternate function of the [observe] button to capture with the same period.

Now, turning the [Love control](#controls-love) will move energy from the dry voices to the post-function voices in the song.

  Where the energy flows, the song goes. The Conductor is the one who, by loving, changes the direction of the Song. He is the

  When this control is engaged, it begins a 'change' which transforms the song by recording the [new voices](#indicators-new), until the knob returns to the rest position.

  Turn to move energy from the [voices in the song currently observed by the conductor](#indicators-observation) to [new voices](#indicators-new).

  When the Love knob is turned right from the rest position, towards the band, a 'New Conduction' begins, and new voices become a part of the song.

  Turning the knob more will decrease the love to the observed established voices, until only the new voices are heard.

   When the Love returns, recording ends.

A sound eminates from the flute of life, this sound is Hadit. Nuit is the flute and all it's infinite sonic potential.
