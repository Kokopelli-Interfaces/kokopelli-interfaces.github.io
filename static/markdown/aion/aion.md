  <a name="inputs-" href='#inputs-vbps'>Orchestra</a> - The input of the module.

    > This is where one connects the input signal the module will capture. It may be the audio from your guitar, the sound of a synthesizer being sequenced.. it may also be a capture of other signal types, such as the pitch of a keyboard.

### Outputs

  slug: song
  type: labeled-socket
  -->
  <a name="outputs-song" href='#outputs-song'>The Song</a> - the sum of all the voices in the song.

    > This outputs the Song, meaning, the entirety of the fractal. Send this to the input of your speakers.

    > Other words for 'Song', are Hadit, Sun, & Universe.

  <a name="outputs-observation" href='#outputs-observation'>The Voices Observed by the Conductor</a> - the summed output of the voices in the song which the conductor is observing.

    > Send this signal through a module and back into the [Orchestra input](#inputs-orchestra), to apply functions (e.g. delay, filter, transpose) to the voices the conductor is observing. Now, turning the [Love control](#controls-love) will move energy from the dry voices to the post-function voices in the song.

    > Other words for 'Conductor' are 'Heru-ra-ha, Spirit, &  Consciousness acting in the Universe.

### Controls

* <!---
  x: 10
  y: 52
  slug: love
  type: labeled-socket
  -->
  <a name="controls-love" href='#controls-love'>Love</a> - moves energy from [established voices observed by the conductor](#outputs-observer) to the [new voices being emit by the orchestra](#inputs-orchestra).

  When the Love knob is turned right from the rest position, towards the Orchestra, 'New Capture' mode is engaged, and new voices become a part of the song.

  Turning the knob more will decrease the love to the observed established voices, until only the new voices are heard.

   When the Love returns, recording ends.

    > This is the main output of the emergem suite, and it outputs the created song. Send this to the input of your speakers.

    > The 'Dao'.

    > Other words for 'Song', are 'Hadit, Sun, & Universe.'
