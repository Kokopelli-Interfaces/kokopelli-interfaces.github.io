# The Emergem
> The Emergem is a suite of instruments which provide a means to create and perfect an emergence of audio and visual energy.

An 'emergence of audio and visual energy'?

(maybe excessive vv)
> Emergence is the phenomenon by which separate signals observe one another and thus influence each others advancement, create a higher-order system. (picture of co-square influence)

> By allowing this to continue for millions of years, we are left with the emergence which preserved it's life - ta-da! Humans, opposable thumbs, crops growing from soil..
> It is the principle by which life came to being,


(*)
> Similar to a Digital Audio Workstation, the Emergem allows one to capture audio signals and compose a song.

> It also allows one to capture visual signals.

 Emergence here is when independant energy

Music is an emergence of sound energy.

> The Emergem is a replacement for the DAW live-creation which rivals the expressivity of the DAW.

> The `Circle` and `Aion` modules join to create a workflow with the best of both worlds. With `Circle`, one can live-create a timeline of sound with two buttons and a foot pedal. With `Aion`, one can move back in the progression so to pass over again and perfect the music - one can add, remove, apply audio-fx to, and shape the volume of sounds. The result is a novel music workflow based around live-creation which rivals the expressivity of the DAW.
