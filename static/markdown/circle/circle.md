> Dynamic Fractal Live-Looper

> Live-loopers are easily used but they lack the ability to express more than a loop of sounds. Digital-Audio-Workstations can create perfected timelines of sounds, but the mind energy they require interrupts music flow. The `Circle` and `Timeline` modules join to create a workflow with the best of both worlds. With `Circle`, one can live-create a timeline of sound with two buttons and a food pedal. With `Timeline`, one can navigate the timeline so to pass over again and add, remove, apply audio-fx to, sequence, and shape the volume of sounds. The result is a novel music workflow based around live-creation which rivals the expressivity of the DAW.
