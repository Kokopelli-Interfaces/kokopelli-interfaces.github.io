# Kokopelli Interfaces
> Instruments based in music, for music


> At Kokopelli Interfaces, we create instruments that help you express your body's energies with sound. We help bring the village inside, outside. Touched by eons of past concert with the universe, the band these villagers co-create is the expression of an ancient body - with all the marks of the love it's past ancestors had for life. Whether it's song be a voice singing the truth of a grieving resonance atop a heart, a bass-guitar-gut powering a crown of electric guitars and light, or visionary waterfalls of trumpets and violins expanding the glowing light pads of a heart, Kokopelli Interfaces' mission is to help manifest it!
>
> We look to a frontier of music devices that are expressive *and* welcome one to stay body-energy-aligned while using them. We want music interfaces that say - '*I see you human, and let's emerge together!*'. We create them by being true to the realities of experience and energy, serving the abundant ocean inside, and whispering *'as above, so below'* under the moon at night.
>
> For the love of the music that passes through the body, and the endless life which comes for those who permit it to play, we wish you a pleasant stay.
