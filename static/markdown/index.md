> At Kokopelli Interfaces, we create interfaces that help one express their body's energies with sound. We help bring the village inside, outside. These village members have travelled millenia through ancestral lines, taking form through past and present concert with the universe - they sing with the creative force of life! - and arrive in the form of energy. Whether it be a humming melancholy above the stomach, a chariot of energetic taps dancing with the mind, or a pad glowing to mirror the flames in a heart, Kokopelli Interfaces is here to help manifest it. 
>
> Our dream is for music creation devices that are expressive *and* welcome one to stay creatively-aligned while using them. We want music interfaces that say - '*emerge together!*', so we design with the principles: 
  > 'Be true to experience, not technology', 
  > 'Body first, mind second', and most importantly, 
  > 'As within, so without'.
