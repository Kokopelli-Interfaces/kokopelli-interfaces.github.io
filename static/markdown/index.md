> At Kokopelli Interfaces, we create instruments that help you express your body's song. We help bring the village music circle inside, outside. Touched by eons of past concert with the universe, this music circle is the expression of an ancient body singing for the love of life. Whether it's song be a voice singing the truth of a grieving resonance atop a heart, a bass in the gut powering a crown of electric guitars and light, or visionary waterfalls of trumpets and violins expanding the glowing light pads of a heart. What endless music this body plays! However unique yours may be, Kokopelli Interfaces' mission is to help manifest it.

> We look to a frontier of music devices that are expressive *and* welcome one to stay body-energy-aligned while using them. We want music interfaces that say - '*I see you human, and let's emerge together!*'. We create them by being true to experience, not technology, serving the abundant ocean inside, not a dark sky, and following the ancient principle: *'as within, so without'*.
