> At Kokopelli Interfaces, we create interfaces that help you express your body's energies with sound. We help bring the village inside, outside. These village members have travelled millenia through your ancestral lines, touched by past and present concert with the universe - they sing as the creative force of life! - arriving in the form of energy. Whether it be a grieving resonance above the stomach, a chariot of energetic taps riding the passion center, or a glowing pad mirroring the flames in a heart, Kokopelli Interfaces mission is to help manifest it.

> We look to a frontier of music devices that are expressive *and* welcome one to stay body-energy-aligned while using them. We want music interfaces that say - '*I see you divine human, and let's emerge together!*'. We create them by being true to experience, not technology, prioritizing the body, not the mind, and following the ancient principle: *'as within, so without'*.
