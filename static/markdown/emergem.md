> The core of the Emergem is the Hearth module, and the rest of the modules serve to expand Hearth.

> The `Hearth` and `Aion` modules join to create a workflow with the best of both worlds. With `Hearth`, one can live-create a timeline of sound with two buttons and a foot pedal. With `Aion`, one can move back in the progression so to pass over again and perfect the music - one can add, remove, apply audio-fx to, and shape the volume of sounds. The result is a novel music workflow based around live-creation which rivals the expressivity of the DAW.
